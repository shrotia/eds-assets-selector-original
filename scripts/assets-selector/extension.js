/**
 * The `AssetSelectorExtensionConfigurations` constant is a Map object that holds configuration options for the Asset Selector.
 * Each configuration option is a key-value pair where the key is the name of the configuration and the value is its setting.
 *
 * In this case, the `AssetSelectorExtensionConfigurations` Map is initialized with two configurations:
 * 1. `videoBlockName`: This configuration sets the name of the video block. It is set to 'Core Embed (Variant 1)'.
 * 2. `imageAsAnchor`: This configuration determines whether the image block should be used as an anchor. It is set to 'true'.
 *
 * The `new Map()` constructor is used to create a new Map object with the provided iterable (an array of arrays) as an argument.
